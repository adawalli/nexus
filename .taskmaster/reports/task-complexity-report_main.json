			"reasoning": "High complexity due to comprehensive scope covering testing, documentation, and multiple client integrations. Current 5 subtasks are appropriate as they logically separate concerns: testing, core documentation, client-specific guides, troubleshooting, and examples. Each subtask has clear deliverables and dependencies."

			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the advanced search features into subtasks focusing on model configuration, parameter management, caching implementation, request deduplication, and performance optimization with proper dependency ordering and performance benchmarking.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving multiple technical components: model selection, caching, concurrency, and performance optimization. Current 5 subtasks appropriately separate concerns with logical dependencies. Each subtask addresses a specific technical challenge with clear testing strategies."

			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity requiring systematic approach to error handling across multiple layers. Current 5 subtasks properly separate error classification, logging, messaging, recovery, and protocol integration. Well-structured dependencies ensure proper foundation before building advanced features."

			"reasoning": "Very high complexity as it addresses fundamental build system issues blocking development. Current subtasks seem misaligned with the task description (focusing on analytics rather than build fixes). Needs 7 subtasks to properly address: module resolution, husky cleanup, TypeScript errors, test compilation, script validation, type checking, and comprehensive verification."
