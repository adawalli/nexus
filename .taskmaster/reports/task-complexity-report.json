			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Test Framework Setup with Vitest",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "The current subtasks are well-structured but could benefit from adding a pre-commit hook integration subtask to ensure tests run automatically on code changes. Consider adding performance testing setup and CI/CD integration subtasks.",
			"reasoning": "Task has moderate complexity with 6 existing subtasks covering installation, configuration, directory structure, coverage, and utilities. The pre-commit hook subtask (#6) is already identified but needs proper integration. Complexity is manageable due to well-defined testing framework setup."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "OpenRouter API Client Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Current subtasks appropriately cover the core API client functionality. Consider adding subtasks for request/response logging, API versioning support, and connection pooling for production readiness.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to external API integration, authentication, streaming responses, and error handling. The 5 existing subtasks provide good coverage of TypeScript interfaces, HTTP client, endpoints, error handling, and streaming. Well-structured breakdown for a complex integration task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "MCP Server Framework Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Current subtasks cover the essential MCP server components well. Consider adding subtasks for MCP protocol version compatibility, server metrics/monitoring, and client connection management for production deployment.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to MCP protocol implementation, STDIO communication, and server lifecycle management. The 5 existing subtasks appropriately break down project setup, transport, routing, logging, and lifecycle management. Complex protocol implementation requires careful handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Core Search Tool Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Current subtasks provide good coverage of the search tool implementation. Consider adding subtasks for search result ranking/filtering, query preprocessing/sanitization, and search analytics/metrics collection.",
			"reasoning": "Moderately high complexity due to integration between multiple components (Zod validation, OpenRouter client, MCP registration). The 5 existing subtasks cover input validation, API integration, response formatting, core function, and MCP registration effectively."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Environment Configuration and API Key Management",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Current subtasks appropriately cover configuration management. Consider adding subtasks for configuration hot-reloading, configuration backup/restore, and multi-environment configuration management (dev/staging/prod).",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity focused on secure configuration handling. The 5 existing subtasks cover schema validation, configuration manager, documentation, secure logging, and application integration. Well-structured approach to configuration management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Error Handling and Logging Enhancement",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Current subtasks comprehensively cover error handling and logging. Consider adding subtasks for error analytics/reporting, log aggregation integration, and error notification systems for production monitoring.",
			"reasoning": "Moderately high complexity due to comprehensive error handling across multiple components and MCP protocol integration. The 5 existing subtasks cover error types, structured logging, user-friendly messages, recovery mechanisms, and MCP integration effectively."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Advanced Search Features and Performance Optimization",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Current subtasks cover performance optimization well. Consider adding subtasks for search result personalization, advanced caching strategies (Redis integration), and performance monitoring/alerting systems.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple performance optimization techniques, caching implementation, and concurrent request handling. The 5 existing subtasks appropriately cover model selection, parameters, caching, deduplication, and response optimization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Integration Testing and Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Current subtasks provide comprehensive testing and documentation coverage. Consider adding subtasks for automated documentation generation, video tutorials/demos, and community contribution guidelines.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity focused on testing and documentation quality. The 5 existing subtasks cover integration tests, README documentation, client integration guides, troubleshooting, and usage examples. Well-organized approach to project completion."
