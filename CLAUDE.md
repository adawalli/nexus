## Pre-Commit Guidelines

- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before attempting commits - This should be run repeatedly until all tests pass before committing
- Never run `git commit --no-verify` unless explicitly directed to do so. You see an issue, you fix it.

## Single Test Execution

To run a specific test file during development:

```bash
# Run a specific test file
npm test -- tests/unit/clients/openrouter.test.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern
npm test -- --grep "OpenRouter"

# Run tests in watch mode for specific file
npm run test:watch -- tests/unit/tools/search.test.ts
```

## Configuration and Environment

### Environment Variables

The project uses environment variables for configuration:

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - Required for OpenRouter API access
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment setting (development, production, test)
- Log levels and other settings are managed through the configuration system

### Configuration Architecture

The project uses a sophisticated configuration system in `src/config/`:

- **Schema validation** - Comprehensive environment validation using JSON schema
- **Type safety** - Full TypeScript typing for all configuration options
- **Logging integration** - Structured logging with Winston, configured via config
- **Error handling** - Detailed configuration error reporting with validation feedback

## MCP Server Architecture Details

### Request Flow

1. **Initialization**: Configuration validation → Logger setup → Search tool initialization → Plugin system ready
2. **Tool Registration**: Search tool with input/output validation schemas
3. **Request Handling**: Correlation ID generation → Input validation → Deduplication → Caching → API execution
4. **Resource Management**: Configuration status endpoint with health monitoring and metrics
5. **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with correlation tracking and performance metrics

### Error Handling Strategy

- **Layered Error Handling**: Plugin-level, tool-level, and server-level error boundaries
- **Error Classification**: Categorized error types (auth, rate_limit, validation, timeout, etc.)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Server continues operation even with individual component failures
- **Correlation Tracking**: Request correlation IDs for distributed tracing and debugging
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs, performance metrics, and error context
- **User-Friendly Responses**: Clear, actionable error messages with troubleshooting guidance

- **Configuration Validation**: Runtime configuration validation with detailed error reporting

## Development Workflow Integration

### Task Master Commands

This project integrates with Task Master for workflow management. Key commands available in this project:

```bash
# Initialize Task Master project structure
task-master init

# View current tasks and status
task-master list

# Get next task to work on
task-master next

# Mark task as completed
task-master set-status --id=<id> --status=done

# Expand complex tasks into subtasks
task-master expand --id=<id> --research
```

See `.windsurfrules` for complete Task Master workflow documentation.

## Testing Strategy

### Test Organization

- **Unit tests** - Individual component testing with mocking
- **Integration tests** - End-to-end MCP server testing
- **Fixtures** - Structured test data and mock responses
- **Coverage requirements** - 90% threshold across all metrics

### Mock Strategy

- **MSW** for HTTP API mocking
- **Vitest mocking** for module dependencies
- **Structured mocks** - Organized in `tests/utils/mocks/`

### Running Tests

- Use `npm test` for single run with coverage checking
- Use `npm run test:watch` for development with file watching
- Use `npm run test:ui` for visual test interface
- Integration tests: `npm run test:integration`
