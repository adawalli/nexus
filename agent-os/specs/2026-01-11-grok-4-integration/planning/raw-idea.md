# Raw Idea

**Grok 4 Integration** - Add support for xAI's Grok 4 (`x-ai/grok-4`) as an alternative model option. 256K context, $3/$15 per M tokens, supports parallel tool calling and multimodal inputs.

This is for the nexus-mcp project which is a Model Context Protocol server providing AI-powered web search.
