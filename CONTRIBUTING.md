- Include integration tests for MCP functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Aim for high test coverage

### Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Include code examples in documentation
- Keep documentation current with code changes
